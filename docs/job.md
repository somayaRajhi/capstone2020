# Job

A job defines work that needs to be done by the client.  Jobs are stored in the server and communicated to a client when the `get_work` endpoint is called.

## Job Classes

In the application, each job is represented as an object.  Regardless of type, all jobs contain

* `job_id` - A unique id for each job.

### `DocumentsJob`

* `page_offset` - The page offset (`po`) parameter in the query.  This name mirrors the name in the API, but these names are misleading!  The value represents the offset as measured in *results*.  Since we will download documents in increments of 1000, the `page_offset` value will be 0, 1000, 2000, ...
* `start_date` - The start date for the search
* `end_date` - The ending date for the search


### `DocumentJob`

* `document_id` - The ID of the document to fetch

### `DocketJob`

* `docket_id` - The ID of the docket to fetch

### `DownloadJob`

Download jobs represent work to download attachments or file formats, both of which are specified in the results of a query to the `document` endpoint.  For example:

```
"fileFormats": [
    "https://api.data.gov/regulations/v3/download?documentId=EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0028-0108&contentType=pdf",
    "https://api.data.gov/regulations/v3/download?documentId=EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0028-0108&contentType=html"
  ],
```

Because these URLs are already formed, a `downloadJob` simply holds that URL

* `url` - the URL of the attachment or file format


## JSON definition

A job is communicated as a JSON object where key names and values are lower case.  

Jobs are identified by the client, but are given a `job_id` by the server.  Therefore, when a job is sent from client to server as a new job, it *does not* contain a `job_id`.

The JSON contains a `job_type` where possible values are:

  * `documents`
  * `document`
  * `docket`
  * `download`
  * `none` - used to indicate that there is no work to be done.

The JSON also includes relevant data, as defined in the "Job Classes" section, above.
